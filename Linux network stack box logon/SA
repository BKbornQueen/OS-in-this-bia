Linux Situational Awareness


After first obtaining access to a system an operator must gather as much information about their environment as possible, this is referred to as situational awareness. 
pwd is just one command of many on Linux which can provide us some insight.

Other commands to help gain situational awareness:
    1. hostname or uname -a displays the name of the host you are currently on.
    2. whoami shows the user you are currently logged in as 
       (useful after gaining access through service exploitation).
    3. w or who shows who else is logged in.
    4. ip addr or ifconfig displays network interfaces 
       and configured IP addresses.
    5. ip neigh or arp displays MAC addresses of devices observed on the network.
    6. ip route or route shows where packets will be routed, 
       for a particular destination address.
    7. ss or netstat will show network connections or listening ports
    8. nft list tables or iptables -L to view firewall rules.
    9. sudo -l displays commands the user may run with elevated permissions.
    
****Depending on the age and distribution of Linux some commands may not be installed 
or require privilege escalation through sudo to run.
