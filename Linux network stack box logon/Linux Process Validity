look inside a binary 
  use the command strings

ps -elf --forest
  show child processes or forked processes

sticky bit only owner can delete file ie file protection
in other positions rwx
  allows special permissions
  elevate to root
  pkill <processname> --signal 9

persistence bit manipulation

    Persistence - Daemons are services that should run for duration of system operation, since init is parent, would require shutdown for parent to die.

    Malicious processes are sometimes orphaned and named to make it look like a daemon process ps --ppid 1 -lf

jobs 
  see background process
hand
  send a process to back so can conitnue working while other job works
<processName> &
  get the pid

sudo lsof -c <processname>
Interpreting file descriptors (FD column of lsof command) FD example: #r
  This information and more available in the lsof man page.
  
  # - The number in front of flag(s) is the file descriptor number used by the process associated with the file
    u - File open with Read and Write permission
    r - File open with Read permission
    w - File open with Write permission
    W - File open with Write permission and with Write Lock on entire file
  mem - Memory mapped file, usually for share library
orphans have a pid of 1
  may be listed with orignal pid, and ordered/listed near pid1
  is adopted by /usr/sbin
  spawns and dies periodically
  htop 
    monitor for orphans and zombies
