What command lists the contents of directories in Linux/Unix systems?
ls
For the ls command, what arguments, or switch options, will allow you to print human-readable file sizes in a long-list format?
The flag is entire command, including arguments
ls-lh
  This command will show you the file sizes in human readable format. 
  Size of the file is very difficult to read when displayed in terms of byte. 
  The (ls -lh)command will give you the data in terms of Mb, Gb, Tb, etc.
What character will pipe the standard output from
echo "I’m a plumber"
to another command, as standard input?
|
What argument/switch option, when used with man, will search the short descriptions and man-page-names for a keyword that you provide?
The flag is the complete command, with argument/switch.
man -k
What is the absolute path to the root directory?
/
What is the absolute path to the default location for configuration files?
/etc
What is the directory that contains executable programs (binaries) which are needed in single user mode, to bring the system up or to repair it?
/bin
What is the absolute path to the directory which contains non-essential binaries that are accessible by standard users as well as root?
/usr/bin
An absolute path to a directory which contains binaries only accessible by the root user, or users in the root group.
/sbin

What is the absolute path for the binary cat man-page?
Research: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/man.1.html
  find absolute path of a command
  which cat
  
  location of the man pages
  man -w <command>
  /usr/share/man/man1/cat.1.gz
  
  All absolute path location for a command
  whereis <command>
  whereis cat
  cat: /bin/cat /usr/share/man/man1/cat.1.gz
echo <string> | sha512sum

Search the man pages for the keyword digest. Then, use one of the binaries listed to hash the string OneWayBestWay using the largest sha hash available.
The resulting hash is the flag.
man -k digest
echo OneWayBestWay | sha512sum


Use File: /home/garviel/Encrypted
This file contains encrypted contents. Identify its file type, then decode its contents.
Hint: Use OpenSSL
Research: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/enc.html
Reminder: All challenges are done using the Terra box.
Answer: DeCrypt
Methodology:
1) Determine file type
  file * <filenameNoExtension>
    if file is a zipped archive file or Zip Archive Data
    it must be unzipped
    cannot decrypt a zipped file, the file must be unzipped
2) Unzip a file No options
  unzip <filenameNoExtension>
    OutputGenerated:
    Archive: Encrypted
      extracting: cipher
      extracting: symmetric
3) Cat the contents of the file to View contents
  cat <extractedContents>
      cat cipher
          Salted__f;M3~4fB  ////<ThisIsTheEncryptedContentsExtractedFromTheZippedFile>////
                            ////< file to be decrypted>/////
      cat symmetric
          AES128Key         ////<ThisIsThePlainTextPassKeyOrPasswordExtractedFromTheZippedFile>///
                          ////<Identifies encoding/encryption type///
4) Use Openssl to decrypt
Openssl <command> <filepath>
openssl enc -aes128  -d -in cipher -salt -k AES128Key
openssl <command(encoding)> <option(encodingSeries/type)> <action> <to> <what> <what'sType> <passkeyoption> <passkey>
openssl <command> <option> <
To Encrypt:
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in file.txt -out file.enc
To Decrypt:
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in file.enc -out file.dec



To encode:

cat 'yourfile' | openssl aes-128-cbc > 'encrypted file'

To decode: First, you have to remember your password which you used to encode, then:

cat 'encrypted file' | openssl enc -d -aes-128-cbc -k 'Your password' > 'decrypted file'

Search the user home directories to find the file with the second-most lines in it. 
The flag is the number of lines in the file.
Hint: Exclude the VDI file!
find /home/garviel -type f -exec wc -l {} + | sort -rn
find <filepath> -type f -exec wc -l {} + | sort -rn
Answer:20k
    find : search for files on the path you want. If you don't want it recursive, and your find implementation supports it, you should add -maxdepth 1 just before the -exec option.
    exec : tells the command to execute wc -l on every file.
    sort -rn : sort the results numerically in reverse order. From greater to lower.

(that assumes file names don't contain newline characters).


Read the file that contains the user database for the machine. Identify a strange comment.
Answer:Traitor
5th column/section GECOS is for comments

Identify all members of the lodge group. List their names in alphabetical order with a comma in between each name.
Flag Format: name,name,name
